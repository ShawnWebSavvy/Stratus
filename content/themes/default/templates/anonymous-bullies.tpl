                            The internet can be a dangerous place.
                            For some, social media has become a
                            vicious arena, especially as users are given
                            more and more anonymity. Stratus has
                            taken notice of this and designed its system
                            with the goal of providing a peaceful, safe
                            and clean environment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="col-text">
                            One of the ways Stratus has done this is
                            through near instant profile verification
                            on many of its platforms. The prestigious
                            blue checkmark is not for the super
                            famous anymore.

                        <p class="subpageLightText">
                            Anyone can now apply for identity verification, which will publicly validate their true identity. This allows users
                            to easily differentiate legitimate users from
                            trolls, catfish and possible threats.
